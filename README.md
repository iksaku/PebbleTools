# PebbleTools

This is a simple tool created to provide examples on how to work with your `Pebble Smartwatch` using some console commands.
Current project is based on [libpebble2](https://github.com/pebble/libpebble2/) as an API for pairing and working directly with your Pebble Smartwatch.


### Installation
